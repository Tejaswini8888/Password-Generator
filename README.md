# 🔐 PyPassword Generator – Python Project

A simple Python program that generates a secure password based on user input. You choose how many **letters**, **symbols**, and **numbers** you want in your password.

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. The program asks:
   - How many letters?
   - How many symbols?
   - How many numbers?
2. It randomly picks characters from each category
3. Combines them into a strong password

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Lists and string manipulation
- Loops and random selection
- User input with `input()`
- Basic password security logic

---
